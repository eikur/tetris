# Tetris tribute
This project's first version was completed in June 2013. Later in 2016, I updated the SDL library and functions up to version 2.0 without modifying the original project structure to be as faithful to the source as possible. This basically means that the code is improvable, and also that sound was not included in the revision (may be as well a good reason to retake this project in a near future).

It has been programed with no IDE under Linux Ubuntu 14.02, and the source code does *not* include the SDL libraries needed to be compiled correctly. What is in fact included, however, is all the art resources due to its reduced weight. 

In the realeases tab there is a Windows executable if you wish to skip the compiling / converting the project process.
